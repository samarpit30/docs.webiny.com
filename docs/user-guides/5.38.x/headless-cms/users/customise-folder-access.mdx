Webiny's security feature called Folder Level Permissions enables you to allow access to a folder to a specific user(s) or team(s). In this tutorial, we will learn how to allow acces to a folder to a specific user in the File Manager. We will do this in _ steps:

- Step 1: Create a folder
- Step 2: Give access to a user

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have the **John Doe** user in your Webiny instance. If you don't have it, please follow the [Creation of User](/docs/{version}/user-guides/headless-cms/users/user-creation) tutorial to create it.
