## Page Builder

### Pages Not Being Shown In Folders (with Folder Level Permissions Enabled) ([#3838](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3838))

With this release, we've fixed an issue where, with the [Folder Level Permissions](/docs/enterprise/aacl/folder-level-permissions) feature enabled, one or more pages would sometimes not be shown in a folder. 

<Image src={pagesNotShownInFolder} alt={"Pages Incorrectly Not Visible In a Folder"} />

Essentially, this issue was caused by an incorrect underlying database query, whose purpose was to ensure only pages that the user has access to are shown in the folder.

This issue has now been fixed, and the pages should be shown correctly. 

### Replaced JsonPack with GZIP For Page Content Compression ([#3839](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3839))

When pages created with Webiny's Page Builder application are stored in the database, the page content data is compressed to reduce the size of the data. Prior to this release, we were using [JsonPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpack) for this purpose. With this release, we've replaced JsonPack with [GZIP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gzip-js).

This change was made because, in some cases, the page content data was still too large to be stored in the database. This was especially true for pages that contained a lot of content.

With this change, the page builder data is now reduced by an extra 20-80%, depending on the size of the content JSON. Most importantly, this change further reduces the chances of the page content data being too large to be stored in the database.
