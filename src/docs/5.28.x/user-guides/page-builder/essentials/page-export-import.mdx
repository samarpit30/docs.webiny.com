Webiny allows you to import and export pages between different locales and instances. In this tutorial we will learn how to import and export pages in the page builder. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Export a page
- Step 2: Import a page


## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a page in the page builder to import. If you don't have a page, please follow the [Create Page](../essentials/create-page) tutorial to create it.


## Step 1: Export a Page

In this step, we will export the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page we created in the [Create Page](../essentials/create-page) tutorial *(Ask Swapnil Sir if repetition here is fine)*.

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Select the checkbox on the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** list item in the list of pages.

    **Note**: You can export more than one page at a time by selecting the checkboxes of the pages you want to export.

3. Click the **EXPORT 1 PAGE** icon ( *Ask Swapnil Sir about the Icon* ).

    ✔️ The **Select Page Revision** screen opens.

    **Note**: If you have selected more than one checkbox, the same icon's title will be **EXPORT *N* PAGES** where *N* is the number of selected checkboxes.

    **Note**: If you want to export all the pages at once, don't select any checkbox. Then, the same icon's title will be **EXPORT ALL PAGES**.

4. Select revision:

    | If                                                                                        | Then                 |
    | :---                                                                                      | :---                 |
    | You want to export the published revision of the selected page                            | Click **Published**  |
    | You want to export the latest revision of the selected page that may not be published     | Click **Latest**     |

5. Click **CONTINUE**.

    ✔️ A screen appears with the prompt **Your export is now ready!**

6. Click the **COPY** icon ( *Ask Swapnil Sir about the icon* ) to copy the export URL.

    (Or click **DOWNLOAD** to download the ZIP archive.)

7. Click **CLOSE**.


## Step 2: Import a Page

In this step, we will import the page we exported in Step 1. For this, you need to open the locale or instance in which you want to import the page.

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Click the **kebab menu** icon ( ⁝ ) beside the **+ NEW PAGE** button.

    ✔️ Menu opens.

3. Click **Import Pages**.

    The **Select a category** screen opens.

4. Click **Static**.

5. Click **PASTE FILE URL** to import the page with the copied URL.

    (Or click **UPLOAD FILE** to import the page with the downloaded ZIP archive.)

6. Paste the copied URL in the **File URL** textbox and click **CONTINUE**.

    ✔️ The **Import Pages** screen appears with the message "All pages have been imported".

    (Or upload the downloaded ZIP archive.) -> *(Ask Swapnil Sir - Error in uploading file - "Unsupported file type.")*

7. Click **CONTINUE**.

    ✔️The **Pages** screen opens with the imported pages available in the list of pages.
