- how to create a page for multiple locales

</Alert>

Similar to [Content Localization](../link) in Headless CMS, Webiny allows creating different versions of the same page for different locales. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a page for multiple locales. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Create a New Category in a New Locale
- Step 2: Create a New Page in the New Locale


## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need the following:

1. The **it-IT** locale in which we will create the page. If you don't have the **it-IT** locale, please follow the [Content Localization](../link) tutorial to create it.
2. The **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page. If you don’t have the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page, please follow the [Create Page](../essentials/create-page) tutorial to create it.


## Step 1: Create a New Category in a New Locale

1. From the Side Menu, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Categories**.

    ✔️ The **Categories** screen opens.

2. Click on the **LOCALE** dropdown in the header section and select **it-IT** to switch to the Italian locale.

    ✔️ The **Categories** screen in the **it-IT** locale opens.

3. Click **+ NEW CATEGORY**.

    ✔️ The **New Category** form opens.

4. In the **Name** textbox, type **Static**.

5. In the **Slug** textbox, type **static**.

6. In the **URL** textbox, type **/static/**.

7. In the **Layout** dropdown, select **Static page**.

8. Click **SAVE CATEGORY**.

    ✔️ The message "Category saved successfully." displays.


## Step 2: Create a New Page in the New Locale

In this step, we will export the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page from the US locale and import it into the Italian locale.

If you are not familiar with how to import and export a page, please follow the [Page Export Import](../essentials/page-export-import) tutorial.

1. From the Side Menu, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Click on the **LOCALE** dropdown in the header section and select **en-US** to switch to the US locale.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen in the **en-US** locale opens.

3. Export the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page.

4. Copy the export URL.
    
    (Or download the ZIP archive.)

5. Click on the **LOCALE** dropdown in the header section and select **it-IT** to switch to the Italian locale.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen in the **it-IT** locale opens.

6. Import the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page under the **Static** category with the copied export URL (or the downloaded ZIP archive).

7. Edit the imported page and update the following values:

    | Field         | Current Value                                                           | Updated Value                                                                    |
    | :-------      | :----------------------------------------------                         | :--------------------------                                                      |
    | Page Title    | The benefits of a Serverless CMS                                        | **I vantaggi di un CMS Serverless**                                              |
    | H1            | The benefits of a Serverless CMS                                        | **I vantaggi di un CMS Serverless**                                              |
    | H2            | Increase your business resiliency and reduce infrastructure spend       | **Aumenta la tua attività resilienza e ridurre la spesa infrastrutturale**       |
    | H3            | By switching to Webiny these are the quantifiable gains you can expect: | **Passando a Webiny questi sono i guadagni quantificabili che puoi aspettarti:** |

    **Note**: Similarly, you can update other parts of the page. Or you can create an entirely different page for the new locale.

8. Click **PUBLISH CHANGES**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens with the message "Your page was published successfully!".

Now, when a user from Italy visits the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page, they will see the Italian version of the page.
