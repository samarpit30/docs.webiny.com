Webiny stores every saved/published change in a content entry as a separate revision.  
In this tutorial, we will learn how to publish a previous revision of a content entry.
We will also learn how to create a new content entry from a revision.
As an example, we will use the **Product** content model that we created in the [Create Content Model](../essentials/create-content-model) tutorial:

We will do this in 3 steps:
- Step 1: Create a content entry in the **Product** content model and make some revisions of it.
- Step 2: Publish a previous revision.
- Step 3: Create a new content entry from a revision.

## Step 1: Create a Content Entry and its Revisions

If you are not familiar with how to create a content entry, please follow the [Create Content Entry](../essentials/create-content-entry) tutorial.

1. Create a content entry in the **Product** content model with the following attributes:

    | Field       | Value                                                                                           |
    | :-------    | :----------                                                                                     |
    | Name        | **Solid Round Neck Blue T-Shirt**                                                               |
    | Description | **Type: Round Neck / Sleeve: Half Sleeve / Fit: Regular / Color: Blue / Fabric: Cotton Blend**  |
    | Price       | **15**                                                                                          |
    | Category    | **Clothes**                                                                                     |

    **Note**: If you haven't added the **Category** field to the **Product** content, either follow the [Reference Field](../essentials/reference-field) tutorial or skip the **Category** field.

2. Now, update the **Name** and **Description** textboxes with the following values:

    | Field       | Value                                                                                                           |
    | :-------    | :----------                                                                                                     |
    | Name        | **Men's Solid Round Neck Blue T-Shirt**                                                                         |
    | Description | **Type: Round Neck / Sleeve: Half Sleeve / Fit: Regular / Color: Blue / Fabric: Cotton Blend / Ideal For: Men** |

3. Click **SAVE & PUBLISH**.

    **Note**: Clicking **SAVE** will create a new revision of the content entry with updated field values and save it as a draft.
    Whereas clicking **SAVE & PUBLISH** will create the revision and publish it.

    | :-------    | :----------                                                                                                       |
    | Name        | **Women's Solid Round Neck Blue T-Shirt**                                                                         |
