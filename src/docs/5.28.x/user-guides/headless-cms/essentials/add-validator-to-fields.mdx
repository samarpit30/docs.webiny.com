A validator helps you make sure that the information provided by a user is correct and meets specific requirements. 
It ensures that the information user enters matches the expected format.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to add validators to a content model's fields.
As an example, we will add validators to the LONG TEXT and NUMBER fields used in the Product [content model](../essentials/glossary#content-model) we created in the [Create Content Model](../essentials/create-content-model) tutorial.
