Webiny allows you to add multiple users with different roles to your instance. You can define a custom user role with constrained access by creating a user group. 
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a user group with limited access to the CMS. Then we will create a user within that user group.

As an example, we will create a user group with the following access constraints:

- Access to view and update a specific content model group.
- Access to view, create, and update all content models inside the content model group.
- Access to view, create, and update the content entries inside the content models.


We will do this in 3 steps:
- Step 1: Create a user group.  
- Step 2: Define access constraints.
- Step 3: Create user within the user group.


## Step 1: Create User Group
1. From the **Side Menu**, Click **Settings** > **Groups**. 

2. Click **+ NEW GROUP**.
   
   ✔️ The **Untitled** screen opens.

3. In the **Name** textbox, type **E-Commerce**.

4. In the **Slug** textbox, type **e-commerce**.

5. In the **Description** textbox, type **User group for E-Commerce project managers**.


## Step 2: Define Access Constraints

1. Under the **Permissions** section, in the **Content** accordion, click **All locales**.

2. Under the **Permissions** section, click **Headless CMS**.

    ✔️ The **Headless CMS** accordion opens.

3. In the **Access Level** dropdown, click **Custom access**.

4. Under **GRAPHQL API TYPES**, select all the three - **Read**, **Manage**, and **Preview** checkboxes.

5. Under the **CONTENT MODEL GROUPS** section:

    a. In the **Access Scope** dropdown, click **Only specific groups**.

    ✔️ A list of Content model groups in the current locale appears.
    
    b. Select the **E-Commerce** checkbox.

6. Under the **CONTENT MODELS** section:

9. Click **SAVE GROUP**


## Step 3: Create User

1. From the **Side Menu**, Click **Settings** > **Users**

2. Click **+ NEW USER**.

    ✔️ The **New User** screen opens.

3. In the **First Name** textbox, type *new user's first name* ( Ex: John ).
