1. Create a user role with the following attributes:

    | Attribute    | Value                                                          |
    | :-------     | :----------------------                                        |
    | Name         | **Headless CMS Access US**                                     |
    | Slug         | **headless-cms-access-us**                                     |
    | Description  | **Grants full access to Headless CMS in en-US locale**         |
    | *Permissions*|                                                                |
    | Content      | Content can be accessed on > **Specific locales** > **en-US**  |
