- how to add a path aliases to a file in File Manager.

</Alert>


Webiny enables users to generate path aliases for files in the file manager, streamlining accessibility. Users can specify a custom path for the file and utilize it efficiently according to their needs. In this tutorial, we will learn how to add a path alias to a file. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Add a path alias to a file
- Step 2: Preview the file using the alias


## Step 1: Add a path alias to a file

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **File Manager**.

    ✔️ The **All files** screen opens.

2. Hover over the **Webiny CMS** image we uploaded in the [File Upload](../file-manager/upload-file) tutorial.

3. Click the **SETTINGS** icon (⚙️).

    ✔️ The **File details** screen opens.

4. In front of **FILE ALIASES**, click **+ ADD ALIAS**.

    ✔️ The **Alias** textbox appears.

5. In the **Alias** textbox, type **/custom/path/files/images/webiny-cms.png**.

6. Click **SAVE FILE**.

**Note**: You can add multiple aliases to a file.


## Step 2: Preview the file using the alias

1. Open the **File details** screen for the **Webiny CMS** image.

2. Click the **COPY URL** icon.

3. Visit the URL in a new browser tab.

4. After the base URL, replace the *path of the file* with the alias. For example, in the address bar, change the text from 
**https://d2m4t9crjg9wlm.cloudfront.net/files/655b590133c6bb000871662f/webiny-cms.png** 
to 
**https://d2m4t9crjg9wlm.cloudfront.net/custom/path/files/images/webiny-cms.png**.
