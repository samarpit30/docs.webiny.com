Webiny enables users to execute bulk actions, such as moving and deleting multiple files simultaneously. In this tutorial, we will learn how to move multiple files from folder to another.


1. From the **Side Menu**, click **File Manager**.

    ‚úîÔ∏è The **File Manager Home** screen opens.

2. In the root folder, create a folder titled **CMS Images**.

    **Note**: If you are not familiar with how to create a folder, please follow the [Organizing Files](../file-manager/organizing-files) tutorial.

3. In the root folder, over the **Webiny CMS** image we uploaded in the [File Upload](../file-manager/upload-file) tutorial, click the **SELECT** icon (‚òëÔ∏è).

    ‚úîÔ∏è A file action bar appears below the search bar.
